## Dataset Details

The dataset consists of more than 1.2M images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2.0, using textual prompts coming from the COCO dataset for image captioning. As such, it contains clusters of five generated images sharing the same semantics and generated from five different textual prompts. In comparison with existing datasets for deep fake detection, it features more diversity, uniform coverage of semantic classes, and can easily be expanded to a larger scale.

The Stable Diffusion v1.4 version of the dataset is available for download at: https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/releases/fake_coco.tar.gz.
